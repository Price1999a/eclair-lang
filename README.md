# eclair

An experimental and minimal Datalog implementation, for better understanding how
certain compiler algorithms work.


## Why the name?

Eclair is inspired by [Souffl√©](https://souffle-lang.github.io/), a high
performance Datalog that compiles to C++. Because of the similarities, I chose a
different kind of food. I mean, an eclair contains *both* chocolate and
pudding, what's not to like!?
